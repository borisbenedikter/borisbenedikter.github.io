            <p class="subtitle">Advancing safe, intelligent, and verifiable autonomy for next-generation aerospace and robotic systems.</p>
            <p>
                I am a Postdoctoral Research Associate at the University of Arizona, where I develop methods for <strong>trustworthy aerospace autonomy</strong> by combining the mathematical rigor of control theory with the adaptability of modern AI. 
                My research unifies <strong>optimal control, convex optimization, and machine learning</strong> to design autonomous spacecraft, rockets, UAVs, and robotic systems that operate safely and reliably in uncertain and dynamic environments.
